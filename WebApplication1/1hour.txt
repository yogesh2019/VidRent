	here let take a look at route config
		here we have a route with name default
		if url mathes this pattern
		first part : name of contorller
		second part: name of the action
		third part: is the id which we can pass to the action

		with this rule 
		if we have /movies/popular
		its gonna hit a popular under movies controller

		we can see we have some default values in here
		if our routes doesn't have any part it will passed to the route controller

		and also if it only has controller and no action defined
		then it will hit index metho
	
		/movies => moviesController.index()

		and also we can see that id is an optional parameter
