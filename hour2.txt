in our solution ex add one class new movie under Model
we give a couple of prop 
like int id and string name
this is a poko which represent state and behaviour of our app
here we have only props for this case 

so assuming that this page will be 
/movies/random

so we need to create a controller 
called movies controller with action as random

so in solution exp right click controller
add controlle 

and empty controller


so this controller is a very simple class that derives from Controller class


here i will change the index to Random

so we will call /moview/random

if we dont use resharper then we have to declare namespace by ourself

if real world app we ofter get Models from database

for now lets just focus on core building blocks of our app

and the reason this view file is red as it is telling us this view doesn't exist		


so if we see inside movies under view we dont have view


we will create a partial view

that we can use at different placess

so let untick this for now

and let chose that we want a layout 


let chose by default layout

here in this block we have two properties
viewBag.title
Layout

now if we see view is no longer red

so we will output this model in our view

in out html

<h2>
	@Model.
</h2>

at the top we need a directive to specify the type of the model for this view


@model lowercase
@model Vidly.Models.MOvie

if in this file if we press f5 
then it will take us to movies.random()


this def looks ugly
our asp.net app uses bootstrap as css framework

bootswatch

so under lumen bootstrap.css
under the content folder 
bootstrap-lumen.css

now we need to replace the refrence

under app.start open up bundle config

the bundling reduces the no of http requests	

so we will modify the css bundle

asp.net mvc fundamentals
entity framework(code first)
forms 
validation

we will use api to build restful services

after this we will shift our focus to client side devlopment

we will use identity framwork 

authenticatoin and autherization

performance optimization

building a feature end to end

deployement
